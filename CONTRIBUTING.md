Contributions are welcome, will be a bit hard however since we cannot really do team- and branch-development with Magic XPA and Git and with Magic XPA Single User edition, which is used here not anyway since Teamdevelopment is disabled in that version of the product. That's a problem with all the other "enterprise features" of course too: They won't work with this version of the product so we can not add demos for these features to the XPA project.
If there's somebody who want's to contribute - contact me and we will work out something.
