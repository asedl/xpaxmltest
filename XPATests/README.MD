# XPATests Magic XPA 3.3 (SingleUser) demo project

Currently this project contains samples / demos for following usecases 

## Alternatives for Magic's built-in Http Functions (HttpCall, HttpGet, ..)
### Using a .NET (C#) script from command line to request a URL (Http GET)
Plan is to compile the script(s) to assemblies., that's however not yet done.
In order to get these samples running you need something which allows you to execute .NET scripts.
The Testprogram uses scriptcs, which you need to download and install in order to get these samples working
-> http://scriptcs.net/

### Using cURL to request a URL (Http Get)
Very complete implementation of HTTP (and other protocols) client.
In order to get this sample(s) working you need to download and install cURL for Windows.
Since it will run in its own process you can use both: The 64-Bit or 32-Bit version
-> https://curl.haxx.se/

### Using Apache Http component/core to request a URL from a Java library
### Using Magic HttpCall to request a URL with Magic native functionality
### Using a .NET (C#) inline code (snippet) to request a URL via Http GET from Magic

## MS Office stuff / Apache Poi
### Export XLS/SLSX to CSV via Magic & Apache Poi

## XSLT/XQUERY / Saxon HE
