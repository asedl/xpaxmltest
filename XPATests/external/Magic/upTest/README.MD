# upTest uniPaaS 1.9 sample application

This is a uniPaaS 1.9 sample application. Before you can run it, you need to:

## Adjust your magic.ini
Add following two logical names and adjust them to your installation of XPATests project:
AppPath = C:\magic\projects\xpaxmltest\XPATests\external\Magic\upTest\
XPATEST_HOME = C:\magic\projects\xpaxmltest\XPATests\

## scriptcs
In order to get those parts of the application running which do execute C# scripts from command line you need to download and install scriptcs [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/)

## cURL
In order to get the CURL samples working you need to download and install [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/).
Since we do not use the libraries but the exe which runs in its own process you can either use the 64-Bit or 32-Bit version of cURL.
