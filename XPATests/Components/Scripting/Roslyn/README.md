# Roslyn.ecf / .edp
Magic XPA component which encapsulates some of the functionality of "Roslyn", the .NET Compiler platform.

Plan is to encapsulate some of the features of "Roslyn" resp. the .NET Compiler platform (shipping with the SDKs) as well as features of the .NET framework to allow code analysis and compilation inb order to use C# for scripting in Magic XPA applications without the requirement to install additional products (provided that you need a .NET Framework on a client machine anyways for a Magic XPA application).
