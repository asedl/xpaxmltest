Sample test project "XPATest" with sample code for development tool "Magic".

In order to execute the sample projects you will need a copy of that development tool (current version: "Magic XPA 3.3").
There's a free "Magic XPA 3.3 SingleUser" available as a download from the vendor's website. Most of the samples in this repository are written for eactly that version as the target so you should be able to execute (most of) the samples- If you download Magic XPA (SingleUser) ... it ships with quite a lot of samples too.
